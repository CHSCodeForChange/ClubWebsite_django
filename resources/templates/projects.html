          <h3>Sapphire Volunteer Management</h3>
          <p>A volunteer management and hour tracking system developed for Exodus Refugee Immigration Inc. This organization expressed that their current paper-and-pencil system for tracking volunteers is very labor intensive, requiring a staff member to pend hours a week crunching the numbers. Our solution not only makes it easier for volunteers to find potentinal opportunities, it also allows organizations to track the hours performed by each volunteer.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The site is currently in Beta mode, meaning it is only used by Exodus, but it will soon be available for any organization to use with only a minimal hosting and domain charge.</p>
